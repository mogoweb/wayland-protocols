  <description summary="Protocol for creating input methods">
    This protocol allows applications to act as input methods for compositors.

    An input method context is used to manage the state of the input method.

    Text strings are UTF-8 encoded, their indices and lengths are in bytes.

    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
    "should", "may", etc.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the
    experimental phase. Backwards incompatible major versions of the
    protocol are to be expected. Exposing this protocol without an opt-in
    mechanism is discouraged.

  <interface name="xx_input_method_v1" version="2">
    <description summary="input method">
      An input method object allows for clients to compose text.

      The objects connects the client to a text input in an application, and
      lets the client to serve as an input method for a seat.

      The xx_input_method_v1 object can occupy two distinct states: active and
      inactive. In the active state, the object is associated to and
      communicates with a text input. In the inactive state, there is no
      associated text input, and the only communication is with the compositor.
      Initially, the input method is in the inactive state.

      Requests issued in the inactive state must be accepted by the compositor.
      Because of the serial mechanism, and the state reset on activate event,
      they will not have any effect on the state of the next text input.

      There must be no more than one input method object per seat.
    </description>

    <event name="activate">
      <description summary="input method has been requested">
        Notification that a text input focused on this seat requested the input
        method to be activated.

        This event serves the purpose of setting up and starting the input
        method engine.

        This event resets all state associated with previous enable, disable,
        surrounding_text, text_change_cause, and content_type events, as well
        as the state associated with set_preedit_string, commit_string, and
        delete_surrounding_text requests. It marks the
        xx_input_method_v1 object as active. It makes any existing
        zwp_input_popup_surface_v2 objects visible.

        This marks the wl_keyboard bound to this input method as enabled. That
        means the wl_keyboard starts receiving events originally destined for
        the surface which activated this input method. Those events must get
        filtered according to .keyboard_consume (using a mechanism outside
        the scope of this protocol) before finally reaching the original
        target surface. See .keyboard_consume.

        The surrounding_text, and content_type events must follow before the
        next done event if the text input supports the respective
        functionality.

        State set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied on
        the next xx_input_method_v1.done event, and stay valid until changed.

        This event marks the xx_input_method_v1 object as inactive. The
        compositor must make all existing zwp_input_popup_surface_v2 objects
        invisible until the next activate event.
        This event marks the wl_keyboard bound to this input method for
        deactivation. It will no longer receive events, and the original
        surface receives all events again as normal, until the next .activate.

        State set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied on
        the next xx_input_method_v1.done event, and stay valid until changed.

    <event name="surrounding_text">
      <description summary="surrounding text event">
        Updates the surrounding plain text around the cursor, excluding the
        preedit text.

        If any preedit text is present, it is replaced with the cursor for the
        purpose of this event.

        The argument text is a buffer containing the preedit string, and must
        include the cursor position, and the complete selection. It should
        contain additional characters before and after these. There is a
        maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be longer than 4000
        bytes.

        cursor is the byte offset of the cursor within the text buffer.

        anchor is the byte offset of the selection anchor within the text
        buffer. If there is no selected text, anchor must be the same as
        cursor.

        If this event does not arrive before the first done event, the input
        method may assume that the text input does not support this
        functionality and ignore following surrounding_text events.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They will get applied
        and set to initial values on the next xx_input_method_v1.done
        event.

        The initial state for affected fields is empty, meaning that the text
        input does not support sending surrounding text. If the empty values
        get applied, subsequent attempts to change them may have no effect.

        Whenever the client detects an external change in text, cursor, or
        anchor position, it must issue this request to the compositor. This
        request is intended to give the input method a chance to update the
        preedit text in an appropriate way, e.g. by removing it when the user
        starts typing with a keyboard.

        cause describes the source of the change.

        Text input state (content purpose, content hint, surrounding text, and
        change cause) is conceptually double-buffered within an input method
        context.

        Events modify the pending state, as opposed to the current state in use
        by the input method. A done event atomically applies all pending state,
        replacing the current state. After done, the new pending state is as
        documented for each related request.

        Events must be applied in the order of arrival.

        Neither current nor pending state are modified unless noted otherwise.

      <description summary="consume key down or up event">
        This requst controls the filtering of input events reaching the
        application.

        Whenever the input method is activated, the compositor must start
        sending it keyboard events intended for the text-input client,
        so that the input method can be controlled using a keyboard.
        Traditionally, from the user perspective, input methods receive keys
        as if they were an overlay: keys which are interesting to the nput
        method gain a special input method meaning, all others work as usual.
        Together with the wl_keyboard provided in .activate, this request
        makes this possible by letting the input method indicate which events
        it is interested in.

        Splitting one stream of keyboard events between two destination
        contains a tension: on one hand, both destinations may be interested
        in the actual buttons being pressed, and on the other hand, most
        of the time the abstract event they are interested in is the keysym
        delivered in response to user action. The concept of key repetition
        is based on that second understanding. Any solution trying to send
        key events must be aware of the repetition in order to provide a
        user experience similar to using a single application, that is,
        not having multiple first-repetition delays after pressing a key.

        Here, this is solved by making both destinations (input method and
        compositor or text input client) conceptually swap the "ownership"
        of the current state of the keyboard. A switch in ownership, from
        the perspective of the user, keeps the continuity of key presses
        and doesn't trigger an extra repetition or an extra delay.

        For this, the input method may choose in which time slices it "owns"
        the keyboard. To do this, the input method must respond to every key
        press or release event with the keyboard_consume event indicating the
        selected owneship: action.start means that the input method takes the
        ownership, action.pause means that the text input client does. The
        "skip_repetitions" argument discloses exactly which time slice the
        request applies to, with "0" meaning immediately.

        This event may be sent multiple times with the same serial to indicate
        the taking or releasing of ownership as needed.
        Time slices begin counting from the time of the first .keyboard_consume
        request. The compositor must respond with an error "too late" if
        the indicated time slice is in the past.

        The input method may send requests for events in the future, but it's
        advised not to act on those events until the indicated time passes,
        in case the state changes, e.g the key is released.

        On the change of a keymap or delay properties, all requested ownership
        changes are invalidated and the current event is owned by the text
        input client again.


        There are two main architectures on the compositor side to make this
        approach work:

        1. When the text-input client is not aware of the filtering

        The compositor sends the keyboard events to the input method and
        waits for .keyboard_consume requests. The compositor filters the
        events and forwards the keyboard events to the text-input client.

        keyboard
              V
        compositor -> input method
              |               |
        [key events]      [ownership requests]
              V           /
        compositor     /_
              |
        [filtered events]
              V
        text-input client

        This method offers low delay and doesn't require text-input client
        support. On the other hand, it requires the compositor to send
        synthetic events and alter key repetition delay values.

        Consider the situation where the user holds the A key, and the
        [i]nput method is interested in every other repetition. The
        [c]ompositor sends the rest to the [t]ext input client: "itititit".

        The sequence of events for this would look similar to:

        1. c->i: wl_key(A, down, 0)
        2. i->c: consume(0, start, 0)
        [some time possibly passes]
        3. i->c: consume(0, stop, 1)
        [about the delay time passes]
        4. c->t: set_delay(0)
        5. c->t: wl_key(A, down, 0)
        6. c->t: set_delay(original value)
        [maybe time passes]
        7. i->c: consume(0, start, 2)
        8. i->c: consume(0, stop, 3)
        [time approximatly equal to 1 delay + 2 repetitions passes]
        9. c->t: set_delay(0)
        10. c->t: wl_key(A, down, 0)   ---- this is the synthetic event
        11. c->t: set_delay(original value)


        2. When the text-input client is aware of the filtering

        The compositor sends the keyboard events to the input method and
        waits for .keyboard_consume requests. The compositor sends both
        the keyboard events and received .keyboard_consume requests to the
        text-input client, and the text-input client internally filters and
        acts on the keyboard events.

        keyboard
              V
        compositor -> input method
              |               |
        [key events]      [ownership requests]
              V           /
        compositor     /_
              |
        [key events and indcators]
              V
        text-input client

        The responsibility to control repetition is on the text-input
        client. The text-input client is aware that it shares the keyboard
        with the input method and it must filter the keyboard events in the
        same way as the input method.


        Other architectures are possible, e.g. one where events first arrive
        at the text-input clients, but they are not described here because
        it's not clear to the author what advantages they might provide.

        Apply state changes from commit_string, set_preedit_string and
        delete_surrounding_text requests.

        The state relating to these events is double-buffered, and each one
        modifies the pending state. This request replaces the current state
        with the pending state.

        The connected text input is expected to proceed by evaluating the
        changes in the following order:

        1. Replace existing preedit string with the cursor.
        2. Delete requested surrounding text.
        3. Insert commit string with the cursor at its end.
        4. Calculate surrounding text to send.
        5. Insert new preedit text in cursor position.
        6. Place cursor inside preedit text.

        The serial number reflects the last state of the xx_input_method_v1
        object known to the client. The value of the serial argument must be
        equal to the number of done events already issued by that object. When
        the compositor receives a commit request with a serial different than
        the number of past done events, it must proceed as normal, except it
        should not change the current state of the xx_input_method_v1 object.

        useable, e.g. due to seat removal.
