  <description summary="Protocol for creating input methods">
    This protocol allows applications to act as input methods for compositors.

    An input method context is used to manage the state of the input method.

    Text strings are UTF-8 encoded, their indices and lengths are in bytes.

    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
    "should", "may", etc.

  <interface name="wp_input_method_v3" version="1">
    <description summary="input method">
      An input method object allows for clients to compose text.

      The objects connects the client to a text input in an application, and
      lets the client to serve as an input method for a seat.

      The wp_input_method_v3 object can occupy two distinct states: active and
      inactive. In the active state, the object is associated to and
      communicates with a text input. In the inactive state, there is no
      associated text input, and the only communication is with the compositor.
      Initially, the input method is in the inactive state.

      Requests issued in the inactive state must be accepted by the compositor.
      Because of the serial mechanism, and the state reset on activate event,
      they will not have any effect on the state of the next text input.

    <event name="activate">
      <description summary="input method has been requested">
        Notification that a text input focused on this seat requested the input
        method to be activated.

        This event serves the purpose of providing the compositor with an
        active input method.

        This event resets all state associated with previous enable, disable,
        surrounding_text, text_change_cause, and content_type events, as well
        as the state associated with set_preedit_string, commit_string, and
        delete_surrounding_text requests. In addition, it marks the
        wp_input_method_v3 object as active.

        The surrounding_text, and content_type events must follow before the
        next done event if the text input supports the respective
        functionality.

        State set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied on
        the next wp_input_method_v3.done event, and stay valid until changed.

        The app ID identifies the general class of applications to which
        the current input method context belongs. An input method framework
        can use this to manage individual state for different text input
        clients.

        For D-Bus activatable applications, the app ID is used as the D-Bus
        service name.

        The compositor shell will try to group application surfaces together
        by their app ID. As a best practice, it is suggested to select app
        ID's that match the basename of the application's .desktop file.
        For example, "org.freedesktop.FooViewer" where the .desktop file is
        "org.freedesktop.FooViewer.desktop".

        See the desktop-entry specification [0] for more details on
        application identifiers and how they relate to well-known D-Bus
        names and .desktop files.

        This event removed all state associated with a text input.

        The app ID identifies the general class of applications to which

    <event name="surrounding_text">
      <description summary="surrounding text event">
        Updates the surrounding plain text around the cursor, excluding the
        preedit text.

        If any preedit text is present, it is replaced with the cursor for the
        purpose of this event.

        The argument text is a buffer containing the preedit string, and must
        include the cursor position, and the complete selection. It should
        contain additional characters before and after these. There is a
        maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be longer than 4000
        bytes.

        cursor is the byte offset of the cursor within the text buffer.

        anchor is the byte offset of the selection anchor within the text
        buffer. If there is no selected text, anchor must be the same as
        cursor.

        If this event does not arrive before the first done event, the input
        method may assume that the text input does not support this
        functionality and ignore following surrounding_text events.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They will get applied
        and set to initial values on the next wp_input_method_v3.done
        event.

        The initial state for affected fields is empty, meaning that the text
        input does not support sending surrounding text. If the empty values
        get applied, subsequent attempts to change them may have no effect.

        Whenever the client detects an external change in text, cursor, or
        anchor position, it must issue this request to the compositor. This
        request is intended to give the input method a chance to update the
        preedit text in an appropriate way, e.g. by removing it when the user
        starts typing with a keyboard.

        cause describes the source of the change.

        The value set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied
        and set to its initial value on the next wp_input_method_v3.done
        event.

        The state relating to these events is double-buffered, and each one
        modifies the pending state. This request replaces the current state
        with the pending state.

        The connected text input is expected to proceed by evaluating the
        changes in the following order:

        1. Replace existing preedit string with the cursor.
        2. Delete requested surrounding text.
        3. Insert commit string with the cursor at its end.
        4. Calculate surrounding text to send.
        5. Insert new preedit text in cursor position.
        6. Place cursor inside preedit text.

        The serial number reflects the last state of the wp_input_method_v3
        object known to the client. The value of the serial argument must be
        equal to the number of done events already issued by that object. When
        the compositor receives a commit request with a serial different than
        the number of past done events, it must proceed as normal, except it
        should not change the current state of the wp_input_method_v3 object.

        must be issued after any changes to apply them.

        Text input state (content purpose, content hint, surrounding text, and
        change cause) is conceptually double-buffered within an input method
        context.

        Events modify the pending state, as opposed to the current state in use
        by the input method. A done event atomically applies all pending state,
        replacing the current state. After done, the new pending state is as
        documented for each related request.

        Events must be applied in the order of arrival.

        cursor_begin indicates the beginning of the cursor. cursor_end

        The initial values describing a cursor rectangle are empty. That means
        the text input does not support describing the cursor area. If the
        empty values get applied, subsequent attempts to change them may have
        no effect.

        As of version 2, the values sent with this request are not used
        immediately after they are applied to the text-input state.

        After the pending state is applied with the wp_text_input_v3.commit
        request, the following wl_surface.commit request on the surface with
        text-input focus will cause the values to become active.

        If the surface with text-input focus changes before a wl_surface.commit
        request is sent, the values are discarded.
