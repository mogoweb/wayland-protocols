      <description summary="manager to create placement suggestion objects">
        This interface is a manager used to create placement suggestion objects
        for xdg_toplevels.

        The compositor may choose to restrict the availability of this manager
        based on its internal policy. This might involve checking the client's
        identity (e.g., via app_id or executable path) against a list of trusted
        clients configurable by the user.

            If the toplevel already has a placement object,
            the compositor MUST send the `placement_exists` error.

            This interface can only be obtained once per xdg_toplevel.

    <description summary="Interface for suggesting absolute toplevel placement">
      This interface allows trusted clients to suggest an initial placement
      position for its associated xdg_toplevel window, specified using absolute logical
      coordinates relative to a specific xdg_output.

      Access to create and use this interface is subject to compositor policy.

      The suggested placement is only a hint. The compositor retains full
      authority to determine the final window position. Clients must
      monitor configure events to determine the actual final placement.

      <description summary="destroy the placement suggestion object"/>

    <request name="suggest_position">
      <description summary="suggest placement at absolute logical coordinates on an output">
        Suggests an initial placement position (x, y) for the associated xdg_toplevel.
        The coordinates are in logical pixels, relative to the top-left corner
        of the specified xdg_output's logical area.

        This request serves as a hint to the compositor. The compositor MAY ignore
        this hint entirely or modify the outcome based on its state or policies.
        The client MUST NOT assume the suggestion will be honored precisely.

        This suggestion is primarily intended for *initial* placement and should
        ideally be sent before the first wl_surface.commit that maps the window.
        Compositors are unlikely to substantially alter placement based on
        suggestions sent after the window is already mapped and positioned.

        This request causes the compositor to send `placement_state`, including
        the output and logical coordinates where the toplevel is currently placed,
        or `not_placed`.

    <request name="get_placement_state">
      <description summary="request the current placement state">
        Requests the compositor to send the current placement state, including
        the output and logical coordinates where the toplevel is currently placed.
      </description>
    </request>

    <event name="placement_state">
       <description summary="notify client of current placement state">
         This event notifies the client of the output and logical position where
         the compositor has actually placed the window, typically sent during
         the initial configuration sequence after considering any placement
         suggestions, and in response to a `get_placement_state` request.

         This allows the client to know the result of its suggestion and update
         its stored state accurately. Compositors are not required to send this
         event if no suggestion was made or considered relevant to the final
         placement decision.

         Standard xdg_toplevel.configure events remain the primary source for
         ongoing size, state, and potentially position updates.

    <event name="not_placed">
      <description summary="notify client that placement based on suggestion definitively failed">
        This event is sent if the compositor *cannot* place the toplevel window
        *as suggested*. This might be due to various reasons like no suitable output,
        geometry conflicts, or unresolvable policy restrictions *after considering the suggestion*.
        Receiving this event implies that the compositor will *not* honor the
        placement suggestion and the toplevel might not be placed at all, or will be
        placed using a fallback mechanism unrelated to the suggestion.
